# @vercel/microfrontends

Split apart large applications and develop faster with microfrontends. This package contains library code to be used with Vercel's [microfrontends support](https://vercel.com/docs/microfrontends).

- **Improved developer velocity**: Build and test just the application that you are developing. Independent applications allow each team to choose their own technology stack.
- **Incremental migrations**: Gradually migrate systems to modern frameworks without rewriting everything at once.

See the [full documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/microfrontends) and [examples](https://vercel.com/templates/microfrontends) to learn more.
